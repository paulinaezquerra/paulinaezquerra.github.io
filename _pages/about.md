I am a PhD student in the [Department of Philosophy](https://lsa.umich.edu/philosophy) at the University of Michigan. 

My current research interests lie at the intersection of ethics, feminist philosophy, and moral psychology, with an eye toward incorporating insights from under-theorized Latin American thinkers into discussions of value and rational action within analytic philosophy. I also have interests in Mexican philosophy, social and political philosophy, and theories of human agency. I investigate how our choices shape who we are as moral agents and what we value, how we ought to reconcile internal conflicts between our values, the role of the emotions in our practical and moral reasoning, and how our identities and social practices give shape to human agency. 


Before Michigan, I earned an MA in Philosophy and BAs in both Philosophy and Political Science at the University of Houston.


Outside of philosophy, I share my life with my [husband](http://phkieval.com) and our cat, and I enjoy making jewelry and pottery.
